// The handful of file operations a write-ahead log needs, on the platforms
// flox runs on. Not a filesystem abstraction: `std::filesystem` covers
// naming, renaming and removal portably already. What it does not cover is
// durability, and durability is the reason a journal exists.
//
// One operation genuinely differs, and it is not a matter of spelling.
// POSIX makes a rename durable in two steps: rename, then fsync the
// directory holding it. Windows has no directory handle to sync -- its
// rename is ordered by the filesystem itself. So `syncDirectory` does the
// work on POSIX and nothing on Windows, and the difference is written down
// rather than hidden behind a name that suggests both do the same thing.
