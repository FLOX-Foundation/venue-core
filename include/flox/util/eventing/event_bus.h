// sleeps (see BusyBackoff). It never blocks, which is why an idle consumer
// still costs about a fifth of a core -- the right trade for one bus on
// hardware it owns, and the wrong one for a process holding hundreds of them.
//
// PARKED blocks on a condition variable and is woken by the publisher. It
// costs nothing while idle and pays for that in wake-up latency.
//
// Deliberately not a member of the bus template: a process wires shards,
// feeds and sinks of several bus types to one decision, and a per
// instantiation enum would make that decision untypeable.

// comes back with an answer that is arbitrarily old -- and a fix for a window
// no test can open is a fix nobody can check.
