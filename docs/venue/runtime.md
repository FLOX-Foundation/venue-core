# Runtime and recovery

## Single-writer core

`SequencedShard` runs a symbol's engine as a single-writer state machine behind
the FLOX `EventBus` (Disruptor). Commands are published to the ingress ring;
one consumer journals each command write-ahead and then applies it. All engine
state is owned by that one consumer thread.

```cpp
SequencedShard<LadderBook> shard(cfg, journalPath, book);
shard.submit(InboundCommand{order});   // published to the ring
shard.journaled();                     // records written
```

Symbols are independent (a CLOB has no cross-symbol matching), so each one can
run on its own shard. `SymbolRouter` is the dispatch layer: it owns an engine
per symbol, routes a command to the right one, and exposes `shardOf()` for
partitioning. It dispatches inline on the calling thread; to run shards
concurrently, drive several `SequencedShard`s, each with its own consumer.

```cpp
SymbolRouter<MatchingBook> router(/*shards*/ 4);
auto& engine = router.addSymbol(cfg, sink);
router.submit(cmd);                       // routed by symbol
router.snapshotAccount(acct);             // cross-shard view for a reconnecting client
```

## Determinism

Same commands in, same events out, byte for byte. That is what makes replay
and hot standby work, and the tests enforce it:

- **Every state-mutating input is a command.** Orders, cancels, modifies, mass
  cancels, quotes, last-look decisions, and also `SetMark`, `ApplyFunding`, and
  `AdminCmd` (auction transitions, halts, emergency cancel-all). A crash after
  an opening uncross must recover the same book, so the uncross has to be in
  the stream.
- **No order-sensitive decision reads an unordered container.** Anywhere output
  depends on processing order (ADL victim choice, liquidation order, peg
  repricing, expiry, mass cancel) the ids are collected and sorted first, so a
  replica on a different STL or build makes the same choices.
- **`event_hash.h`** folds the outbound stream into a rolling hash, so two runs
  can be compared in one comparison.

Persistent instrument configuration (tick, lot, bands, risk limits) is
recovered from the configuration store, so it stays out of the WAL and is not
an `AdminCmd`.

## Journal and replay

```cpp
Journal j(path);
j.append(cmd, tsNs);        // write-ahead: record, then apply
j.flush();

for (const auto& [ts, cmd] : Journal::loadTimed(path)) engine.submit(cmd, ts);
```

Records are `[ts:8][tag:1][struct]`; every command type is trivially copyable
(enforced by `static_assert`), so a record is a tag plus a raw blob. The
sequencer timestamp is stored, so `loadTimed` reproduces time-dependent
behaviour (GTD expiry, last-look windows, MMP windows, LULD pauses) at the
same points it happened live.

Replaying from empty must reconstruct an identical ledger, book, positions,
and reservations. `test_venue_engine` asserts the event-stream hash and the
ledger match after a round trip; `test_venue_venue` covers the auction case,
replaying a journal whose stream contains an `AdminCmd` uncross.

## Clock

Time enters through `IClock`, so the same code runs on simulated and real time:

| Implementation | Use |
|---|---|
| `SimulatedClock` | backtests, deterministic replay |
| `SystemClock` (`flox/util/system_clock.h`) | live |

## Client recovery

- **`ResendBuffer`** keeps per-session outbound events for gap-fill, and
  `GapDetector` tells a client when it missed a sequence.
- **`snapshotAccount`** returns an account's open orders (with the true
  remaining quantity, hidden reserve included: the owner sees its whole order,
  unlike the public feed), pending stops, and position, so a reconnecting
  client can reconcile in one shot.
- **Cancel-on-disconnect** optionally pulls a session's resting orders when the
  connection drops.
