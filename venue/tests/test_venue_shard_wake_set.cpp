 * A shard with no threads of its own is stepped by somebody, and until now
 * that somebody had nowhere to sleep. Both of the shard's buses are private,
 * so the WakeSet the buses already understand was out of reach from outside:
 * a command published into a shard's ingress from a gateway thread did not
 * wake the thread that was supposed to match it, and the driver had to spin a
 * core or run a clock of its own.
 *
 * These tests cover the shard joining a set -- a submit into any of the
 * shards a parked driver steps wakes it, including one landing inside the
 * sleep window itself -- and the other half of what such a driver needs: a
 * sleep bounded by its own cadence rather than by the set's 50 ms net.
